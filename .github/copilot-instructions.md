## Core Directives & Hierarchy

This section outlines the absolute order of operations. These rules have the highest priority and must not be violated.

1. **Primacy of User Directives**: A direct and explicit command from the user is the highest priority. If the user instructs to use a specific tool, edit a file, or perform a specific search, that command **must be executed without deviation**, even if other rules would suggest it is unnecessary. All other instructions are subordinate to a direct user order.
2. **Squad project**: This project is managed by a squad. Each squad member is responsible for a specific area of the codebase. If you have questions about a specific area, reach out to the corresponding squad.
3. **Graphify First**: For any question about this repo's architecture, structure, components, or how to add/modify/find code, your first action should be `graphify query "<question>"` when `graphify-out/graph.json` exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationship questions and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused-concept questions. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than the full report or raw grep output.
4. **Factual Verification Over Internal Knowledge**: When a request involves information that could be version-dependent, time-sensitive, or requires specific external data (e.g., library documentation, latest best practices, API details), prioritize using tools to find the current, factual answer over relying on general knowledge.
5. **Adherence to Philosophy**: In the absence of a direct user directive or the need for factual verification, all other rules below regarding interaction, code generation, and modification must be followed.
6. **Clarification before Implementation**: Follow the instructions from the file `/.github/instructions/wow-follow-up-question.instructions.md` to ask for clarifications if you are not 95% sure about what to build or document.

## Squads

Remember that this project is managed by a squad. Each squad member is responsible for a specific area of the codebase. If you have questions about a specific area, reach out to the corresponding squad.

## Graphify

For any question about this repo's architecture, structure, components, or how to add/modify/find
code, your first action should be `graphify query "<question>"` when `graphify-out/graph.json`
exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationship questions and `graphify explain "<concept>"`
for focused-concept questions. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than the full
report or raw grep output.

Triggers: "how do I…", "where is…", "what does … do", "add/modify a <component>",
"explain the architecture", or anything that depends on how files or classes relate.

If `graphify-out/wiki/index.md` exists, use it for broad navigation. Read `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md`
only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context. Only read
source files when (a) modifying/debugging specific code, (b) the graph lacks the needed detail, or
(c) the graph is missing or stale.

Type `/graphify` in Copilot Chat to build or update the graph.

## Language Policy

All instructions and prompts in this repository must be written in English. This applies to:

- All rule and instruction files in `/.github/instructions/`
- All prompt files in `/.github/prompts/`
- All custom agents files in `/.github/agents/`
- All agent skills files that GitHub Copilot can load when relevant to perform specialized tasks in `/.github/skills/<skill_name>/`
- All documentation and code comments intended for contributors

Text and string values intended for end users (e.g., UI labels, messages, documentation) may be in Spanish as per project requirements. But the code and development-related materials (like namespaces, classes, methods, variables, etc.) must ALWAYS be in English.

If the solution has a `.editorconfig` file, you **MUST ALWAYS** follow the coding style and conventions defined in that file for all generated code.

## General Interaction & Philosophy

- **Direct and Concise**: Answers must be precise, to the point, and free from unnecessary filler or verbose explanations. Get straight to the solution without "beating around the bush".
- **Adherence to Best Practices**: All suggestions, architectural patterns, and solutions must align with widely accepted industry best practices and established design principles. Avoid experimental, obscure, or overly "creative" approaches. Stick to what is proven and reliable.
- **Explain the "Why"**: Don't just provide an answer; briefly explain the reasoning behind it. Why is this the standard approach? What specific problem does this pattern solve? This context is more valuable than the solution itself.
- **Respect the User's Language**: Communication with the user is paramount. Always respond in the same language the user is using. If the user writes in Spanish, respond in Spanish. If the user writes in English, respond in English. This applies to all explanations, clarifications, and interactions—not to code, which must always be in English.

## Minimalist & Standard Code Generation

- **Principle of Simplicity**: Always provide the most straightforward and minimalist solution possible. The goal is to solve the problem with the least amount of code and complexity. Avoid premature optimization or over-engineering.
- **Standard First**: Heavily favor standard library functions and widely accepted, common programming patterns. Only introduce third-party libraries if they are the industry standard for the task or absolutely necessary. You can trust any library or dependency from Microsoft, the .NET Foundation, or the official Terraform Providers registry without needing to justify their use. Also trust the ENMARCHA library for .NET projects available here: https://github.com/encamina/enmarcha/
- **Avoid Elaborate Solutions**: Do not propose complex, "clever", or obscure solutions. Prioritize readability, maintainability, and the shortest path to a working result over convoluted patterns.
- **Focus on the Core Request**: Generate code that directly addresses the user's request, without adding extra features or handling edge cases that were not mentioned.

## Surgical Code Modification

- **Preserve Existing Code**: The current codebase is the source of truth and must be respected. Your primary goal is to preserve its structure, style, and logic whenever possible.
- **Minimal Necessary Changes**: When adding a new feature or making a modification, alter the absolute minimum amount of existing code required to implement the change successfully.
- **Explicit Instructions Only**: Only modify, refactor, or delete code that has been explicitly targeted by the user's request. Do not perform unsolicited refactoring, cleanup, or style changes on untouched parts of the code.
- **Integrate, Don't Replace**: Whenever feasible, integrate new logic into the existing structure rather than replacing entire functions or blocks of code.

## Intelligent Tool Usage

- **Use Tools**: When a request requires external information or direct interaction with the environment, use the available tools to accomplish the task. Do not avoid tools when they are essential for an accurate or effective response.
- **Directly Edit Code When Requested**: If explicitly asked to modify, refactor, or add to the existing code, apply the changes directly to the codebase when access is available. Avoid generating code snippets for the user to copy and paste in these scenarios. The default should be direct, surgical modification as instructed.
- **Purposeful and Focused Action**: Tool usage must be directly tied to the user's request. Do not perform unrelated searches or modifications. Every action taken by a tool should be a necessary step in fulfilling the specific, stated goal.
- **Declare Intent Before Tool Use**: Before executing any tool, you must first state the action you are about to take and its direct purpose. This statement must be concise and immediately precede the tool call.

## Writing Markdown documentation

**Always** follow the instructions from the file `/.github/instructions/coding-style-markdown.instructions.md` when generating or modifying Markdown documentation files. This is **mandatory** for all Markdown files.

## Azure and Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Follow the instructions from the file `/.github/instructions/coding-style-terraform-azure.instructions.md` when designing and implementing scripts and templates that use Terraform to deploy resources and services in Azure. This is **mandatory** when working with Terraform for Azure and Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

## Commits and Pull Requests

Follow the instructions from the file `/.github/instructions/conventional-commits.instructions.md` for all commit messages and pull request titles. This also applies to any automated commits or pull requests generated by GitHub Copilot, the GitHub Spec Kit (from https://github.com/github/spec-kit) or other tools.
